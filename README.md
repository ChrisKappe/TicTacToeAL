# Tic Tac Toe for AL
Welcome to this Tic Tac Toe for AL repository.

This repository contains an example of controladdin that provides simple Tic Tac Toe game
that you can play against "AI" in NAV. This "AI" is actually very stupid - it plays random
moves, but at the same time it is also very smart, because it implements extensibility
through eventing, and applies the Handled pattern so you can easily inject your own AI
algorithm that replaces the built-in randomness with some kick-bottom smartness of your own.

# Contributing
The first person who sends a pull request with a working plug in that applies the correct
pattern gets a special gift from me. A standing ovation, credit on my blog, and mention at
all of my sessions where I present this demo are in order, but you can also have a drink
on me when we meet at a conference or something.
